### Bundle and simulation properties:

N = 40000 		# Number of fibers

maximum_steps = 100	# Limit number of steps for each change of conditions (for both load and moisture)

load_d = 0.5    	# Load degree compared to a non-slip and dry FBM

period = 10    	# Time interval for each moisture change (normalized by the viscoelastic characteristic time):

cycles_pre_load = 2    # Moisture cycles before loading

cycles_loaded = 2	# Moisture cycles while loaded

cycles_unload = 2	# Moisture cycles after loading







### In case of moisture/load data set add the file names below, if empty the program will use the above defined variables

moisture_df = 

load_df =








### Fiber mechanical properties:

D_d = 1  	# Driest state elastic compliance

D_w =  1.3	# Most wet state elastic compliance

J_d = 0.2	# Driest state viscoelastic compliance

J_w = 0.4 	# Most state viscoelastic compliance

alpha = 0.5 	# swelling coefficient

tau = 0.1






### Threshold properties

m_Weibull = 2		# Weibull shape parameter

lambda_Weibull = 7	# Weibull scale parameter

seed = 39		# Seed for randomize slip thresholds

decay = 11	# Decay for weakening function 

failure_limit = 0.3	# Limit threshold comparing to the first given value

wet_scale = 0.7	# Threshold scaling for wet state

reverse_scale = 0.7	# Threshold scaling for compressed fibers

init_th = 0.000
